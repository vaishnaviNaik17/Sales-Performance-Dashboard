# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
📊 Sales Dashboard in Power BI
Welcome to my Power BI project! This dashboard is built to explore and visualize sales data in a clear and interactive way. It helps you understand how sales, profit, and quantity change across different regions, product categories, and over time.

✅ What This Project Does
This Power BI dashboard shows:

Total sales, profit, and quantity sold as key performance indicators (KPIs)

A bar chart to compare sales by region

Another bar chart to compare sales by product category

A line chart that shows how sales change each month

Filters (slicers) so you can view data by region or category easily
